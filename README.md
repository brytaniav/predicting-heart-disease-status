# Predicting Heart Disease Status

### Description & Objective
This report aims to identify the most suitable classification method for predicting heart disease status. To achieve this objective, multiple classification models will be evaluated and the best classifier will be proposed based on the goodness of fit of each model. 

### Dataset
The dataset used is attached, named "heart-disease-status.csv" and contains 300 observations with 12 feature variables and the heart disease status as the response variable.

### Plan of Analysis
The analysis will follow a structured flow, including:
1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Exploring the variables and examining the associations between the response variable and each input variable.
2. Implementation of methods: KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression.
3. Evaluation and comparison of classifiers: Based on some metrics, such as True Positive Rate (TPR) / Sensitivity, Precision, ROC Curve, and AUC Value.

### Conclusion
Based on comparisons of the TPR, precision, and AUC values, the best classifier for predicting heart disease status is the decision tree. This is because the decision tree has the highest TPR and precision values compared to the other two models (KNN and logistic regression), indicating that the decision tree model predicts the response variable more effectively and demonstrates strong model performance.
